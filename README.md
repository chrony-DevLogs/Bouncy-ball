# Simple Looped 2D Animation in Unity 6

This project demonstrates a simple looped 2D animation made with **Unity 6**. It showcases a basketball that bounces, stops, rotates, and returns to its original position, repeating the animation in a continuous loop.

## Animation Description

- The basketball starts at a high location on the screen.
- It then bounces a couple of times and gradually loses momentum.
- After stopping, the ball rotates on the ground along the X-axis, rolling back to its original starting point.
- Finally, the ball rises up along the Y-axis to its initial height, where the animation starts again from the beginning.

## Resources Used

## How It Works

- The animation begins with a vertical movement (Y-axis), simulating a bounce.
- After a few bounces, the ball transitions into a rolling motion on the X-axis, as if rotating across the ground.
- Once it returns to its original position, it ascends vertically again to repeat the cycle.
  
This project demonstrates a smooth and continuous loop for a simple 2D physics-based animation in Unity.
